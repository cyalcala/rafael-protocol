## Project Overview

This is the initial commit for **Rafael Protocol** - an AI-Native Digital Adoption Platform (DAP) built with modern technologies including Claude Agents, TypeScript, Bun, Trigger.dev, Railway, and Cloudflare.

## What's Inside

This repository contains the architectural documentation and implementation plan for a next-generation Digital Adoption Platform that disrupts traditional solutions like WalkMe by leveraging AI for:

- **Auto-generated guides** - No more manual authoring
- **Self-healing** - Automatically detects UI changes
- **Active execution** - AI performs tasks for users
- **Personalization** - Individual + contextual learning
- **Continuous improvement** - Learns from every session
